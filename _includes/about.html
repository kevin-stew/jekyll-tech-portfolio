        <p> I started learning coding and web-development skills in the late-pandemic era as a way to challenge myself 
          and maybe automate some of the most tedious tasks I found myself doing at work. 
          Eventually I enrolled in a coding bootcamp to accelerate the pace of learning and rapidly expand my horizons. 
          After successfully completing it, I have continued working on web-apps while also gaining experience in new languages and frameworks. 
          I enjoy thinking about how aspects of architectural design could be automated, turning vision into reality, and skiing in deep powder.</p>

        <h4>PREVIOUS WORK EXPERIENCE</h4>

      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <p>Prior to entering tech I spent almost a decade working as a Landscape Architect; 
          first as a designer, then credentialed professional, and finally as a project manager. 
          During that time I had the chance to work on nearly every project type imaginable 
          while gaining valuable skills that are highly transferable. 
          I have project management experience and have worked in both domestic and international settings, 
          with teammates and clients from around the world. 
          The projects I oversaw were complicated and required the coordination of many disciplines 
          that had overlapping scopes.</p>

        <h4>WHY PIVOT INTO TECH?</h4>
        <hr>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <p>In a word: growth. 
          The growth and opportunity available in the tech sector are unrivaled to any other, 
          and with some effort and continued learning it is very accessible. 
          Also - and importantl - I find it very interesting. 
          Because technology has become so integrated into daily life, its influence has an outsized effect on our lived experiences. 
          In the same way I aspired to improve the world through better spatial design, 
          I believe even more potential exists to improve the world, and our day-to-day experiences, through better technology. 
          At the onset of Web 3.0 and a wave of industry disrupting innovations, 
          there is perhaps no better time to join this change and contribute to it.</p>

        <p>In early 2022 I attended a full-time coding bootcamp with Coding Temple; 
          the program provided a comprehensive guide through the fundamentals of computer science and full-stack web development.</p>
