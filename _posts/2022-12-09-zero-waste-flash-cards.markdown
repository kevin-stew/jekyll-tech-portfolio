description: This simple but useful web-app allows users to custom format 12 flash cards with custom content on the front and back of cards, generating a double sided 8.5" x 11" printable PDF file.  While there probably a million free flash card websites on the internet, the innovation with this project is the no-waste minimal-cutting approach; a Bootstap5 flex-box grid layout is used in conjunction with Java Sctipt and custom CSS to all users to enter front/back content from an entry form, see the results in real-time, and make a PDF file when ready.  All cards are the same size when printed using a 'actual size' or 'non-fit' printer setting.  In its current state, cards are best suited to learning foreign language words (or linux bash commands as I am using it) because front of cards are printed in large font and back of cards are printed in smaller descriptive font.  Future versions of this site aim to allow user formatting control for increased card customization.
