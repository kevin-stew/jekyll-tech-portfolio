client: Supliers of Outdoor Construction Materials Everywhere
category: Web Application
description: This project is a 3D file-sharing web platform that helps the suppliers of outdoor construction materials better showcase and sell their inventories to potential buyers (a.k.a. Landscape Architect, normal Architects, & Contractors).  Think of it like a Craigslist for plant nurseries, stone quaryies, or any natural/non-manufacturable construction materials, where simple 3D scans of objects are used to show what's for sale instead of images.  The site was made using a Flask and PostgresSQL backend, with HTML5 + CCS Bootstrap frontend.
